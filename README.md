GitHub will show you the remote URL, in my case:

5. Type the following in Windows PowerShell:

6. Type this to open VS Code

 ** **Important note for Yuri H.:** Never forget the spaces. 😁

## Working Process

Once the VS Code is opened, we can start to type our codes or something. 

To make the code be beautiful and eye-catching, you can use [**THESE**](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) tools from Markdown Cheat Sheet. 

Once the code writing is complete, follow the steps below.

1. Go to **"Vew"** part of the VS code and Coose **"Terminal"**. 
2. Type there:
   > `git add .`
3. After type the following:
    > `git commit -m "a message about what exatly was updated"`
4. Then push the code (type this):
    > `git push`
5. Visit your GitHub account and refresh the page, and you will be amazed 😳😁.
